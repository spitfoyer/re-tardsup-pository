re-tardsup-pository
===================

This is firmware intended for as-yet undeveloped nanobots which will encase and permeate all suppositories by 2025, by which time most every medication, supplement, and nootropic will be administered by suppository.  The goal of this particular project is to code pubelick domain suppository firmware which is tailored to the unique needs of our mentally challenged brothers/sisters/zyorsthers of all creeds, colors, genders and ungenders, except the jews and the turks obviously.  The core founding dev team of this project hopes that it will be as douchey and annoying as possible, so we will probably code it in a combination of Python and JavaScript.  We will give it a web GUI just so we can use lots of JavaScript and CSS.

This project is anonymously funded by notorious child trafficker Warren Buffet, Olympic-level Morrocan-boy-underwear-stealer Bill Gates, and sleazy unscrupulous career politician Al Gore who pays us to only support "energy efficient" nanobots, by which we of course mean those nanobots which are made with parts manufactured by companies Al Gore has stock in.  We try to be an ethical organization, so helping the environment and reducing the human population (especially black people) by any means necessary is very important to us.

Due to gag orders, we aren't allowed to tell you that we cooperate with the NSA, KGB, ISIS, and immortalized flying-saucer-riding nazi scientists.  We can't tell you anything about the plans to give the nanobots 10G networking capabilities and have them phone home to Google every 30 seconds with information collected from installed thermometers to measure your anal temperature, microphones to record everything you say and do, scanners to monitor your entire body and a 50 meter radius around you, identity chips, and GPS chips.

What we can tell you however is that the nanobots will contain many amazing features which may sound a little weird to you, but our secret investors assure us that by 2025 you will be foaming at the mouth to have these and many other like features, and that you will not perceive them as invasive or clearly diabolical at all.  We can't give away too much, but a few of the great features we can announce so far are:
* Time-release packets of sterilizing chemicals so that you need not have any abortions, giving you more time to focus on killing already-born fetuses in the proper factory setting
* Enough highly pressurized, cost effective, mass produced genetically modified astronaut food to sustain you for the remainder of your life, which we are informed will be conveniently capped at 35 years by this time
* Tiny neutron bombs which any law enforcement or extremely wealthy person can detonate at any moment to completely incinerate you for your safety
* And of course iOS


For Hackers:
===================

No coding experience required.  As long as you're a hipster piece of shit and it gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling to be called a "hacker" or even just a "nerd", then we would love to accept your contributions.  All you have to do is find a Python, JavaScript, or CSS tutorial for beginners, preferably written by a typical programmer who simply does not have the social skills required to clearly and concisely teach anybody anything.  You may read this tutorial, or just skim it really since you're probably really smart anyway, and then jump straight into coding and commit your contributions straight away.

When you're doing that though, please keep in hind all the precepts of the re-tardsup-pository project philosophy:

-10. Programming is an artform.  If you need to sacrifice efficiency or intelligent solutions in order to write the source code in the shape of a flower or crane, it's worth it.

-9. Only write efficient code when doing so would mean making it totally unreadable.  This will be particularly easy in Python.

-8. Please be sparse with your comments.  If something is important enough, then you will remember it later.  And if somebody else is too stupid to work out your code on their own, maybe they don't deserve to.

-7. There should be lots and lots of documentation which is highly technical in language and long-winded, but it shouldn't communicate anything of use.  The table of contents should be vauge so that users spend days searching hopelessly through it.  This builds character.

-6. Your code is like your baby, and like a loving mother it should be your wish to feed it and watch it grow big and strong.  Your goal is to make it as large, complex, and monolithic as possible, and you should never remove any part of it.  Would you hack off one of your baby's limbs?

-5. Ask yourself what the bare minimum interaction a user would want to have with the program is, then create a UI which dumbs down those features as much as possible, preferably reducing each one down to a single 500 pixel wide button.  As for all other UI features a user might want, you should neglect to add about half of them.  The other half should be implemented, but extremely obscure and unintuitive.  If anybody asks how to do it, tell them to read the documentation, but before you do that please make sure that the information they are seeking is not present in the documentation.

-4. Don't worry about all that debugging and scalability crap.  The most important thing is for you to contribute as much code as quickly as possible.  It doesn't matter whether it actually compiles or not; users have come to expect running into compiletime errors through no fault of their own.  Nobody will even notice.

-3. Please familiarize yourself with the Unix philosophy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and try to do the opposite of everything it says.

-2. If anybody makes a complaint about or suggestion for the project, tell them to either write the code themselves or shut up.  Please tell the project dictator who this person is so that we can make sure no contributions of theirs are ever accepted.

-1. You are only allowed to release binaries that work only with the most unpopular platforms, so that almost all users who aren't scared away are forced to attempt compiling the source, which should take them at least a few days or ideally never work at all.

0. Please think of the environment...  Okay, did you think of it?  Now for every 10 lines of code you write, please try to cancel out your coding carbon footprint by sacrificing a White or Arab Male, preferably Religious, on an altar to the Triple Goddess.

1. The more non-positive integers a list of philosophical precepts has, the truer it is.
